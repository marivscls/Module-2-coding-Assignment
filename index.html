          <h2>Plato</h2>
            <p>
                Plato (427-347 BC) was a Greek philosopher of antiquity, considered one of the main thinkers in the history of philosophy. He was a disciple of the philosopher Socrates.
                His philosophy is based on the theory that the world we perceive with our senses is an illusory, confused world. The spiritual world is higher, eternal, where ideas really exist, which only reason can know.
